Repository for the training course in web development using Angular, taught at CITIC in March-April 2023. The purpose of this project is to learn the basis of Angular by trying to create a dummy booking application for activities, called ActiviTIC.

## Installation

Cloning, installing and running the project is as simple as executing the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/daniboube/angular-training-course-citic

# Navigate to the directory
cd angular-training-course

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Development server

To run the app, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To run the JSON backend server (just for testing during the development), execute the following command in a separate console:

```bash
npm run api
```

The server will be running at http://localhost:3000/.

## Build

To build the app, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.
